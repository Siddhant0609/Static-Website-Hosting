# Static-Website-Hosting
Created a portfolio website using beginner level Html, CSS and JavaScript. Hosted on AWS Simple Storage Service(AWS S3).
Precautions:
1) Make all objects of AWS S3 public.
2) Don't keep files in a folder rather keep them single objects in bucket.

I created all files public by default.
For which, Policy Generator is used.

All the best!!
